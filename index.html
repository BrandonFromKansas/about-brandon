            <h2>Biography</h2>
        </header>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Kansas but I have lived in Virginia for a little bit as well. I have one brother who is five years younger than me. I have one dog named Arlo and he is about 8 years old.

            <h2>Education</h2>
        </header>
            <p>
                I started my learning journey at Small World pre-school. I logged enough nap hours and had my fill of juice boxes, it was on to bigger and better things at Grace E. Stewart Elementary for the next six years. Grades five through seven were spent awkardly roaming the halls between classes at South Middle School until I was given a piece of paper and told I had to start going to the bigger building across the street. At this bigger building (South High), it was much scarier and the upper classmen were not very chill. However, I survived and I went on to college to try my hand at higher education.

        </header>
            <p>
                My main goal for the next six months is to get through this curriculum with all my hair intact. I don't care if it is all gray by the time it's over with but I would still like to retain at least 99.9% of it.
